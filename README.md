# Study Notes

This repository contains personal notes and examples of syntax and features of programming languages.

## Java

Relevant files and folders are located in the `java/src/com/java` folder. A quick summary follows:

- `/general`: contains annotatios about loops, string methods and arrays.
- `/collections`: common data structures of the Java collections framework.
- `/file/manipulation`: examples using Java's IO module classes to read and write to files.
- `/exceptions`: examples exploring exceptions and try/catch blocks.
- `/modifiers`: examples to illustrate how class, attribute and method modifiers behave, as well as abstract classes and interfaces.

## Python

The `/python` folder contains aptly named directories to illustrate different topics and features of the language.

All scripts can be executed using the `python <file name>` command in the terminal to produce examples.   
*Note: python version 3.10 was used to test these scripts.*
